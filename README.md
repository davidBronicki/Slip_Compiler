# Slip_Compiler

Sort of compiles a dynamically typed language.

This is currently a half baked project. If you want to look at what it does, just compile and link the .cpp files.

In it's current state, it doesn't complete compiling (a previous version was able to do hello world, but that's it). There's still a lot to be done with this.
